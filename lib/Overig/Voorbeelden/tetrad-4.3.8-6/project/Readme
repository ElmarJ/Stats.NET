Tetrad IV is set up to be loaded and run in Intellij IDEA (v. 5.1.1 currently,
7/10/2006). After you've obtained the code etc. in the .../tetrad directory,
to set it up in IDEA do the following:

1. File-->New Project

2. Fill in:

    * Name = Tetrad
    * Project File Location = path to the .../tetrad directory.
    * NEXT

3. Fill in:

    * Project JDK = path to a JDK 1.5+.
    * NEXT

4. Single Module Project should be selected.

    * NEXT

5. Java Module should be selected.

    * NEXT

6. Module content name and path should be selected for you.

    * NEXT

7. Source directory should have been found for you.

    * NEXT

8. Don't bother getting the output directory right quite yet. (See below.)

    *FINISH

9. Click Ant Build on the right border. Click the little plus.
Select .../tetrad/build.xml. When it appears in the Ant Build columns,
right click on it. Select Properties.  Click Additional Classpath.
Add all the jars in /tetrad/lib.

10. Double click the compile target in Ant to run it.

11. Click the little wrench in the tool palette (to the right of the green
triangle).  Click Modules. Click paths. Set the output path to
.../tetrad/build/tetrad/classes. Click Libraries. Make sure all of the
jars in .../tetrad/lib are on in the list. Set the language level to 5.0.

That should be enough to get started.
